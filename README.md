The value must be: Trueto enable, or Falseto disable

mouse_move_speed
You can configure the speed at which the mouse moves on the screen before clicking.
The value must be 0.1:1

How to works?
The bot doesn't change any of the game's source code, it just takes a screenshot of the game's screen to find the buttons and simulates mouse movements.

Adjusting the bot
Why some adjustments might be necessary?

The bot uses image recognition to make decisions and move the mouse and click in the right places. It accomplishes this by comparing an example image with a screenshot of the computer/laptop screen. This method is subject to inconsistencies due to differences in your screen resolution and how the game is rendered on your computer. It's likely that the bot doesn't work 100% on the first run, and you need to make some adjustments to the config file.

Image Replacement
The images were taken on my computer with a resolution of 1920x1080. To replace an image that is not being recognized correctly, just find the corresponding image in the "targets" folder for BombCrypto and "img_compare" for SpaceCrypto, take a screenshot of the same area and replace the previous image. It is important that the replacement has the same name, including the .png extension.
